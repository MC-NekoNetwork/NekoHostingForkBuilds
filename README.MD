# Neko Hosting Fork Builds

This repository contains compiled jar builds of abandoned projects or lazy developer(s) that should just tweak/change few lines of code to make it work... still in use by the community. Our goal is to provide easy access to these valuable resources, ensuring their continued availability and usefulness.

## About This Repository

Many projects, despite being abandoned by their original developers (or being lazy), continue to have active user bases. This repository serves as a central location for compiled builds of such projects, making it easier for users to find and use these tools without having to compile them from source.

## Contents

This repository includes builds for various abandoned projects. Each project has its own directory containing:

- Zipped Buildable Source Codes for all Builds/Jars that come from either a Fork Build or Custom.
- Version Information about what Jar was built for.

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository to find the project you're interested in.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Download the appropriate build you need.
4. Enjoy.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these projects are no longer actively maintained by their original developers or have not gotten around to update the jars for latest versions of minecraft... We update plugins to OUR needs for certain version of Minecraft, you can always provide updates or clean up unneeded code for your usage or for all if WE have not update.

For example if a jar is stuck on l.6.4 and can easily be updated to 1.21.1 then that what we do.
If another example, if the jar is stuck on 1.21.0 but can be really easy to update to 1.21.1 then that purely lazy on developer part and also what we do.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have compiled builds of abandoned projects that are not yet included in this repository, please consider submitting a pull request. Make sure to include:

- The compiled build
- A brief description of the project
- A Working Version (if you need libs please include those jars)
- Version information (This can be like MC Version: 1.21.1)
- Any known issues or limitations

## License

Please refer to the individual project directories for specific license information. We respect the original licenses of all included projects.
Also we go by if source code is open/forkable and available OR its closed source and abandoned (usually no update after 5+ years) then its fair game to decompile and work on a rebuilt jar.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, please open an issue in this repository.
